///   1. An edge with no border yields to one that has it. `none` counts as
///      no border, per *"If the conflicting table cell border is `none` (no
///      border), then the opposing border shall be displayed."*
///   2. Weight = width in eighths of a point × style number. Higher wins.
///   3. Equal weight: the style **earlier in the spec's precedence list** wins —
///      `Single` over `Double`. See `style_precedence_index`.
///   4. Equal style: darker colour wins (`R+B+2G`, then `B+2G`, then `G`).
///
/// **What `nil` does, and what it does not.** The note adds *"If the conflicting
/// table cell border is `nil`, then no border shall be displayed"*, which reads
/// as `nil` beating everything on the far side of the edge. It does not, and
/// implementing it that way deleted borders Word draws. `nil` acts on **its own
/// cell only**: it is how a cell declines the inheritance the note describes one
/// step earlier (style → `tblPrEx` → `tblBorders`), which is the whole of its
/// difference from `none`. The facing cell's border is untouched, so
/// `Suppressed` yields here exactly like `Absent`.
///
/// Three independent facts in `IP 05 Trenches` fix the reading, and no evidence
/// contradicts it:
///
/// * a cell declaring `<w:bottom w:val="single"/>` above one declaring
///   `<w:top w:val="nil"/>` — Word draws the line, as does macOS's own DOCX
///   renderer on the same markup;
/// * a cell that *inherits* its bottom from `insideH`, faced by a `gridSpan=2`
///   spacer cell whose `nil` was aimed at the neighbouring column — Word draws
///   that line too, and it could not do otherwise: a cell paints one border
///   across its whole width, so a wide cell's `nil` cannot punch a hole in the
///   cell above it;
/// * down the document's spacer columns the generator writes `nil` on **both**
///   sides of every shared edge. Writing both is only necessary because one
///   alone does not suppress.
///
/// `nil` is still not a no-op: with nothing facing it — a table's outer edge, or
/// a facing cell that is also `nil` — declining inheritance is exactly what
/// removes the border. Both halves are pinned by
/// `tests/table_border_conflict.rs`.
///
/// **The comparison is a total order, and that is the point.** The caller feeds
/// this (upper row's bottom, lower row's top) and (left cell's right, right
/// cell's left), so a rule that stops at step 2 leaves the winner decided by
/// *which side of the edge a border came from* — an implementation detail. Ties
/// used to fall through to whichever argument came first, which meant an
/// equal-weight 3pt single beat a 1pt double or lost to it depending on
/// argument order, and of two equal borders differing only in colour the paler
/// one won half the time. `resolve_border_conflict(a, b)` now always equals
/// `resolve_border_conflict(b, a)`.
///
